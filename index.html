  <ul>Answer</ul>
  A network application is a software program or service that relies on network <br>
  resources to perform specific functions, enabling communication, data sharing<br>
   and collaboration among devices connected to a network.<br>
   These applications leverage the power of networks, whether local area networks<br>
   (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the internet, to provide various services <br>
   and functionalities. Network applications use network protocols and communication<br>
  standards to transmit and receive data, making them integral to modern computing.<br>

  <p><h1>define the networks</h1>
    A computer network is a group of computers linked to each <br>
    other that enables the computer to communicate with another <br>
    computer and share their resources, data, and applications.<br>
    <h1>write the type of networks </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>LAN</li>
      <li>Wan</li>
      <li>Man</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>what is Lan and explain</h1>
    LAN(Local Area Network)
Local Area Network is a group of computers connected <br>
to each other in a small area such as building, office.<br>
LAN is used for connecting two or more personal computers through a communication<br>
 medium such as twisted pair, coaxial cable, etc.<br>
It is less costly as it is built with inexpensive hardware such as hubs, network adapters, and ethernet cables.<br>
The data is transferred at an extremely faster rate in Local Area Network.<br>
Local Area Network provides higher security.<br>
<h1>what is Man</h1>
MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)<br>
A metropolitan area network is a network that covers a larger geographic <br>
area by interconnecting a different LAN to form a larger network<br>.
Government agencies use MAN to connect to the citizens and private industries.<br>
In MAN, various LANs are connected to each other through a telephone exchange line.<br>
The most widely used protocols in MAN are RS-232, Frame Relay, ATM, ISDN, OC-3, ADSL, etc.<br>
It has a higher range than Local Area Network(LAN).<br>
<h1>use of Man</h1>
<b>use of man networks</b><br>
MAN is used in communication between the banks in a city.<br>
It can be used in an Airline Reservation.<br>
It can be used in a college within a city.<br>
